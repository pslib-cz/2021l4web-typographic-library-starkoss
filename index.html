    <h1>Testing display of HTML elements</h1>
    <p>This page contains a bunch of HTML Elements and text. You can copy the source code and use it test out various
        CSS Properties. For testing purposes, you may use <a href="#">this site</a>.
        Recall that these CSS rules are placed in between the <code>head</code> tags using the following format:</p>

    <div>
        <pre>
            <code>
                code {
                    background: $color-tertiary;
                    border-radius: .4rem;
                    font-size: 86%;
                    margin: 0 .2rem;
                    padding: .2rem .5rem;
                    white-space: nowrap;
                }
            </code>
        </pre>
    </div>

    <h1>This is 1st level heading</h1>
    <p>This is a test paragraph.</p>
    <h2>This is 2nd level heading</h2>
    <p>This is a test paragraph.</p>
    <h3>This is 3rd level heading</h3>
    <p>This is a test paragraph.</p>
    <h4>This is 4th level heading</h4>
    <p>This is a test paragraph.</p>
    <h5>This is 5th level heading</h5>
    <p>This is a test paragraph.</p>
    <h6>This is 6th level heading</h6>
    <p>This is a test paragraph.</p>

    <h2>Basic block level elements</h2>

    <p>This is a normal paragraph (<code>p</code> element). To add some length to it, let us mention that this page was
        primarily written for testing the effect of <strong>user style sheets</strong>. You can use it for various other
        purposes as well, like just checking how your browser displays various HTML elements.</p>

    <div>This is a <code>div</code> element. Authors may use such elements instead of paragraph markup for various
        reasons. (End of <code>div</code>.)</div>

    <blockquote>
        <p>This is a <i>block quotation</i> containing a single paragraph. Well, not quite, since this is not
            <em>really</em> quoted text, but I hope you understand the point. After all, this page does not use HTML
            markup very normally anyway.
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Buttons</h2>
    <div class="buttons">
        <a class="button" href="#">Default Button</a>
        <a class="button button-outline" href="#">Outline Button</a>
        <a class="button button-clear" href="#">Clear Button</a>
    </div>

    <h2>Lists</h2>

    <p>This is a paragraph before an <strong>unordered</strong> list (<code>ul</code>). Note that the spacing between a
        paragraph and a list before or after that is hard to tune in a user style sheet. You can't guess which
        paragraphs are logically related to a list, e.g. as a "list header".</p>

    <ul>
        <li> One.</li>
        <li> Two.</li>
        <li> Three. Well, probably this list item should be longer. Note that for short items lists look better if they
            are compactly presented, whereas for long items, it would be better to have more vertical spacing between
            items.</li>
        <li> Four. This is the last item in this list Let us terminate the list now without making any more fuss about
            it.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is a paragraph before a <strong>ordered</strong> list (<code>ol</code>). Note that the spacing between a
        paragraph and a list before or after that is hard to tune in a user style sheet. You can't guess which
        paragraphs are logically related to a list, e.g. as a "list header".</p>

            they are compactly presented, whereas for long items, it would be better to have more vertical spacing
            between items. </li>
